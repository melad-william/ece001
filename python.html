<p style=color:red;>Python is a language of programming that is interpreted, of high level, of general use.
 Python's design philosophy, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, emphasizes the readability of code with its notable use of significant whitespace.
 Its language structures and object-oriented approach are designed to help programmers write clear , logical code for large and small projects
Python is typed dynamically, and collected from garbage. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured programming (especially procedural), object-oriented, and functional.
 Because of its extensive standard library, Python is often described as a "batteries included" language
