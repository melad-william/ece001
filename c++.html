<p style=color:red;>Is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as a C programming language extension, or 'C with classes.
' The language has expanded significantly over time, and in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation, modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional functions.\
 It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide compilers for C++, including the Free Software Foundation, Microsoft , Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it's available on many platforms.
 C++ was designed with a bias towards system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance , efficiency and usability as its design highlights. C++ was also found to be useful in many other contexts,
 with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers.
