<h1>HTML</h1>
<p style=color:red;>Hypertext Markup Language ( HTML) is the standard language of markup for documents intended for display in a web browser. Technologies like Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages like JavaScript can assist in this.
Web browsers receive Html files from a web server or local storage and render the documents into web pages into multimedia. HTML describes semantically and originally included web page structure indications for the document 's appearance.
HTML may embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects web pages' behavior and content. CSS Inclusion defines content look and layout. Since 1997, the World Wide Web Consortium, former HTML maintainer and current CSS standards maintainer, has been encouraging the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML.
