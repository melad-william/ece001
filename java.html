Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented and designed to have as few dependencies as possible regarding implementation.
 It is intended to allow application developers to write once, run anywhere, which means that compiled Java code can run on all Java-supporting platforms without recompiling.
 Java applications are typically compiled to bytecodes that can run on any Java virtual machine ( JVM), irrespective of the computer architecture underlying.
 Java's syntax is similar to C and C++, but it does have fewer low-level facilities than either. Java was one of GitHub's most popular programming languages as of 2019.
